B.5
20150628
This is the complete Appendix B applied to 6.3.4. Now I can do unit testing
to the additions from 6.4 forward.

At this time, the unit testing fails in testPebblesAvtr. The chatee variable is null.
The expectation is by the end of chapter 6 this will work correctly

B1-express-static_to_B.4.2 
20150625
This is the minimum initial setup to start doing unit testing.
Hopefully, I can swing this code around and use it as the basis for Ch05N06/spa-6.3.4


Ch05N06/spa-6.3.3 is copied and renamed to Ch07/7.2.8.1-express-static/public
Modifcations are applied to add the express webserver. 
The newest express (ver 4 rather than ver3) is used and modifications were necessary to the text book code.
Ch07/7.2.8.1-express-static is copied to App0B/B1-express-static
Modifications are now applied to App0B/B1-excpress-static.
