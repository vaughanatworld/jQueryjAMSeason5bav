This is the minimum initial setup to start doing unit testing.
Hopefully, I can swing this code around and use it as the basis for Ch05N06/spa-6.3.4


Ch05N06/spa-6.3.3 is copied and renamed to Ch07/7.2.8.1-express-static/public
Modifcations are applied to add the express webserver. 
The newest express (ver 4 rather than ver3) is used and modifications were necessary to the text book code.
Ch07/7.2.8.1-express-static is copied to App0B/B1-express-static
Modifications are now applied to App0B/B1-excpress-static.
